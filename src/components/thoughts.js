        content: `in early july, i completed my first two weeks at OpenGradient working with the team in Belgium. 
        
        i found a great deal of pleasure in exploring Brussels. the weaving alleys and nestled cafes & restaurants were very charming, and i was entraced with the architecture.

        the rich history of the region was palpable, immediately evident to me when i visited town hall and the royal palace. 
        
        EthCC proved to be a great experience, and i attended a number of fascinating presentations ranging from agentic ai to zk to the future of web3. 
        
        i listened to great talks from the likes of Justin Drake & Vitalik, and meet with founders from a number of exciting projects.
